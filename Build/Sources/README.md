# Working with esbuild

* **Requirement:** You need to have installed `npm` on your system.
* Run `npm install`. → This adds the needed npm packages in a directory `node_modules`.
* Run `npm run build`. → This creates the resulting JavaScript files in `Resoures/Public/JavaScript`.


## Background
The build step with *esbuild* is added to be able to write modern JS in the development while still having classic JS in the frontend. This avoids repetition of code during development.
