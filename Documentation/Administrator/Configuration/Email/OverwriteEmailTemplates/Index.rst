   :caption: EXT:sitepackage/ext_localconf.php

   $GLOBALS['TYPO3_CONF_VARS']['MAIL']['partialRootPaths']['1588829281'] = 'EXT:sitepackage/Resources/Private/Partials/';
   $GLOBALS['TYPO3_CONF_VARS']['MAIL']['templateRootPaths']['1588829281'] = 'EXT:sitepackage/Resources/Private/Templates/';

The files need then to be placed in a directory named `Mail`.
