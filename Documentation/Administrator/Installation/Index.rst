Installation
============

The installation consists of adding the extension and including the TypoScript.
To get a working cart you need to process further steps which are descriped in
:ref:`the quick start<quick_start>`.

.. _installation_extension:

Install the extension
=====================

Depending on your needs you have three options to install the extension.

Installation using composer
---------------------------

The recommended way to install the extension is by using `Composer <https://getcomposer.org/>`__.

In your composer-based TYPO3 project root, just do

.. code-block:: bash

   composer require extcode/cart

Installation from TYPO3 Extension Repository (TER)
--------------------------------------------------

Download and install the extension with the extension manager module.

Latest version from git
-----------------------
You can get the latest version from git by using the git command

.. code-block:: bash

   git clone git@github.com:extcode/cart.git

.. _installation_typoscript:

Include TypoScript
==================

The extension ships some TypoScript code which needs to be included.
There are two valid ways to do this:

Include TypoScript via TYPO3 backend
------------------------------------

#. Switch to the root page of your site.

#. Switch to the **Template module** and select *Info/Modify*.

#. Press the link **Edit the whole template record** and switch to the tab *Includes*.

#. Select **Shopping Cart - Cart** at the field *Include static (from extensions):*

Include TypoScript via SitePackage
----------------------------------
This way is preferred because the configuration is under version control.

#. Add :typoscript:`@import 'EXT:cart/Configuration/TypoScript/setup.typoscript'`
   to your  `sitepackage/Configuration/TypoScript/setup.typoscript`

#. Add :typoscript:`@import 'EXT:cart/Configuration/TypoScript/constants.typoscript'`
   to your  `sitepackage/Configuration/TypoScript/constants.typoscript`
