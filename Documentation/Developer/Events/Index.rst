Events
======

The extcode/cart extension uses events in some places, especially to
integrate custom requirements in the ordering process.

You can register your own EventListener for the following
events:

.. confval:: \Extcode\Cart\Event\Cart\BeforeShowCartEvent

   Triggered before the cart is shown.

   Allows adaptions of the cart object itself in `CartController` and
   `CartPreviewController`. In the `CartController` the orderItem can changed too.
   This event do not save the changes to the session.

.. confval:: \Extcode\Cart\Event\Cart\UpdateCountryEvent

   This event is triggered when the user changes the country in the order
   form.

.. confval:: \Extcode\Cart\Event\Cart\UpdateCurrencyEvent

   This event is triggered when the user changes the currency in the order
   form.

.. confval:: \Extcode\Cart\Event\Form\AddToCartFinisherEvent

   This event is triggered in `AddToCartFinisher` for form based products.

.. confval:: \Extcode\Cart\Event\Mail\AttachmentEvent

   Allows you to define file paths as attachments for mails send to buyer or
   seller.

.. confval:: \Extcode\Cart\Event\CheckProductAvailabilityEvent

   This event is triggered when it is necessary to check whether a product
   is still available in sufficient quantity in the warehouse.

   The product extensions should implement an EventListener that checks the
   products of this extension.

   If a product is no longer available or not available
   in sufficient quantity, the property `$available` must be set to `false`.

   In addition, the EventListener can pass messages.

   If there is no availability check in the product extension, no
   EventListener needs to be implemented.

.. confval:: \Extcode\Cart\Event\ProcessOrderCheckStockEvent

   The event is triggered in the
   `\Extcode\Cart\Controller\Cart\OrderController::createAction`
   and allows to cancel the further ordering process if the number of
   products in the shopping cart is no longer available in the meantime.

.. confval:: \Extcode\Cart\Event\RetrieveProductsFromRequestEvent

   This event is triggered when an "addToCart" form is submitted.

   The extension passes the form data in this event.

   Each product extension must provide an EventListener for its own product
   type that returns one or more products based on this form data.

   It is up to the product extension how to create these products as instances
   of the class `\Extcode\Cart\Domain\Model\Cart\Product`.

   Products can be loaded from the database, but also created based on the
   form data, or fetched from another system via an API.

.. confval:: \Extcode\Cart\Event\Order\CreateEvent

   This event is used by the extension itself, but can be extended by
   custom EventListeners.

   It is the first event that is called when the order is submitted.
   This event implements the StoppableEventInterface.

.. confval:: \Extcode\Cart\Event\Order\PersistOrderEvent

   This event is triggered by an EventListener which listens to
   `\Extcode\Cart\Event\Order\CreateEvent` (the one here above) so its quite
   at the beginning of the creation of an order.

   This event is used of the extension itself to store the order with all
   needed information (addresses, products, tax classes, usage of coupons,
   payment, shipping and other data related to an order).

.. confval:: \Extcode\Cart\Event\Order\NumberGeneratorEvent

   It is the second event that is called when the order is submitted.

   This event is used by the extension itself, but can be extended by
   custom EventListeners. The EventListeners that the cart extension
   itself registers to this event can very easily be replaced with
   custom EventListeners.

   The event is also triggered in the backend if an invoice or delivery
   number is subsequently generated there, because they should not be
   generated automatically during the ordering process.

   A Payment provider extensions can also trigger this event if the
   payment process was successful and an invoice is to be sent instead
   of an order confirmation.

.. confval:: \Extcode\Cart\Event\Order\PaymentEvent

   This third event in the row can be implemented by payment provider
   extensions to forward to the payment provider at this point.

   In case of forwarding, the processing of the following events should be
   prevented via the `StoppableEventInterface`, because
   `\Extcode\Cart\Event\Order\StockEvent` and
   `\Extcode\Cart\Event\Order\FinishEvent` are only necessary if the
   payment process is successful.

   If the payment process is successful, the payment provider extension
   should trigger the events `\Extcode\Cart\Event\Order\StockEvent` and
   `\Extcode\Cart\Event\Order\FinishEvent` itself.

.. confval:: \Extcode\Cart\Event\Order\StockEvent

   The fourth event should again be used by product extensions if they
   provide stock management.

   The EventListener should perform stock management for products of this
   extension. Either count down the stock counter in the database or tell
   the product service via an interface which products were bought how often.

.. confval:: \Extcode\Cart\Event\Order\FinishEvent

   The fifth and final event in the ordering process is to finish the order.

   This is mainly used by the cart extension itself to finalize the order
   process.

   Here, among other things, emails are sent. Other extensions can
   use this event to generate PDF documents, register users or assign
   registered users to another user group.

.. confval:: `Extcode\Cart\Event\Order\UpdateServiceEvent

   This event is triggered when the payment or shipping of an order is edited
   in the backend.

.. confval:: `Extcode\Cart\Event\Session\AfterRestoreAddressEvent`

   This event is triggered in the `SessionHandler` and can be used to validate
   or change the address after restoring the data them from the session.

.. confval:: `Extcode\Cart\Event\Session\AfterRestoreCartEvent`

   This event is triggered in the `SessionHandler` and can be used to validate
   or change the cart after restoring the data from the session.

.. confval:: `Extcode\Cart\Event\Session\BeforeWriteAddressEvent`

   This event is triggered in the `SessionHandler` and can be used to change
   the address before writing the data to the session.

.. confval:: `Extcode\Cart\Event\Session\BeforeWriteCartEvent`

   This event is triggered in the `SessionHandler` and can be used to validate
   or change the cart before writing the data to the session.
