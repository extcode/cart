=============================================
Feature: 369 - Add Multi-Step Checkout Option
=============================================

See :issue:`369`

Description
===========

Until now, the shopping cart and the ordering process were limited to one page. The new feature allows the ordering process to be stretched over several steps and so users can be guided through the ordering process. How many steps are used can be defined via a new TypoScript configuration variable.
For each step, a template file must define the step. The extension brings an example of a 4-step checkout.
For more information check out the :ref:`multi_step_checkout_configuration` documentation page.
