Note of thanks
==============

A big thank you goes `Tritum GmbH <https://www.tritum.de>`__ for the many hours I was allowed to work on Cart.

In particular, I would like to thank Bj√∂rn. He always has an open ear. He contributed his opinion to many questions
and decisions. Without him, Cart would not be what it is today.

Another thanks goes to the testers for their feedback and understanding when I made changes to the data model again and
again.

A big thank you also goes out to all the supporters on github.
