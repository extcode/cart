Orders
======

The data records of the orders contain the data of an order and should be seen
as immutable.
The data records can be listed and opened in the backend, but changes are not
possible.

It's recommended to use the provided :ref:`en_en_modules-orders`.
This backend module offers an optimized filter to find orders quickly. The
clearer display of individual orders enables better processing of incoming
orders and processing of incoming orders and changing the status for payment
and shipping.
