Flex Prices
===========

Sometimes you won't configure fix prices for an service methods. Especially the shipping costs can
depend on the amount of products in cart. The cart extension provides a service interface and a
default implementation which can handle different kinds of dependencies.
A common condition is the amount of physical products in cart.

Extending Service Calculation
-----------------------------

Sometimes the shipping method has some special rules.
In Germany the Post provides the so called "BÃ¼cherversand" for books. Some rules
apply to this shipping method.

- The weight is included in the price calculation.
- Certain lengths and widths must not be exceeded.
- Furthermore only books may be sent.

Such special rules cannot be mapped using TypoScript configurations. Therefore, a
separate service class can be implemented for a method, which can then return the
calculated price to the shopping cart.

   plugin.tx_cart {
       shippings {
           countries {
              de {
                  preset = 1
                  options {
                      1 {
                          title = Standard
                          className = \\MyVendor\\MyExtension\\MyShippingService
                          taxClassId = 1
                          status = open
                      }
                  }
              }
           }
       }
   }

.. confval:: options.N.className

   :Type: string

   Defines the class which implements the `\Extcode\Cart\Domain\Model\Cart\ServiceInterface`.
   This allows you to implement your own service cost calculation per service method.
   A valid case is, that you have to decide between `serviceAttribute1` (e.g. weight) and
   `service_attribute2` (e.g. size). This is not configurable through TypoScript and heighly
   depends on your delivery service.
