Shipping methods
================

The shipping methods are defined via TypoScript for each shopping cart.
The standard template already comes with a shipping method (standard).

With the definition plugin.tx_cart.settings.allowedCountries the output of
the selector in the shopping cart is defined. The options can also be
translated by an own SelectViewhelper.

.. important::
   The provided TypoScript of the extension provides a configuration and
   translation for the German-speaking area.

The parameter plugin.tx_cart.settings.defaultCountry defines which country
should be preselected.

.. important::
   If different shipping methods are defined for different countries, the
   country of the delivery address is used. Only in the case that no different
   delivery address has been specified, the selection of the billing address
   is used as a basis.

Zone configuration
""""""""""""""""""

If no individual country configuration can be found, it is also possible to
work with zones in the TypoScript.
This saves a lot of configuration work if you want to deliver to many
countries.

::

   plugin.tx_cart {
       shippings {
           zones {
               1 {
                   preset = 1
                   countries = de,at,ch
                   options {
                       1 {
                           title = Standard
                           extra = 0.00
                           taxClassId = 1
                           status = open
                       }
                   }
               }
           }

Deactivate shipping methods
"""""""""""""""""""""""""""

At the moment, the processing does not allow to completely dispense with the
shipping methods. A shipping method must always be be specified. If there is
only one shipping method, the selection block can be hidden.

        settings {
            showCartAction {
                showPartials {

                }
